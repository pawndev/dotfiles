#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

font_family      Roboto Mono for Powerline
bold_font        Roboto Mono for Powerline
italic_font      Roboto Mono for Powerline
bold_italic_font Roboto Mono for Powerline

font_size 13

#: Font size (in pts)

adjust_line_height  0
adjust_column_width -1

#: Change the size of each character cell kitty renders. You can use
#: either numbers, which are interpreted as pixels or percentages
#: (number followed by %), which are interpreted as percentages of the
#: unmodified values. You can use negative pixels or percentages less
#: than 100% to reduce sizes (but this might cause rendering
#: artifacts).

symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A2,U+E0B0-U+E0B3,, Symbola

#: Map the specified unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful
#: if you need special rendering for some symbols, such as for
#: Powerline. Avoids the need for patched fonts. Each unicode code
#: point is specified in the form U+<code point in hexadecimal>. You
#: can specify multiple code points, separated by commas and ranges
#: separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple
#: times. Syntax is::

#:     symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name

box_drawing_scale 0.001, 1, 1.5, 2

#: Change the sizes of the lines used for the box drawing unicode
#: characters These values are in pts. They will be scaled by the
#: monitor DPI to arrive at a pixel value. There must be four values
#: corresponding to thin, normal, thick, and very thick lines.

#: }}}

#: Cursor customization {{{

cursor #e5c7a9

#: Default cursor color

cursor_shape block

#: The cursor shape can be one of (block, beam, underline)

cursor_blink_interval      0.5
cursor_stop_blinking_after 15.0

#: The interval (in seconds) at which to blink the cursor. Set to zero
#: to disable blinking. Note that numbers smaller than repaint_delay
#: will be limited to repaint_delay. Stop blinking cursor after the
#: specified number of seconds of keyboard inactivity. Set to zero to
#: never stop blinking.

#: }}}


#: Scrollback {{{

scrollback_lines 2000

#: Number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back.
#: Memory is allocated on demand.

scrollback_pager less --chop-long-lines --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS +INPUT_LINE_NUMBER

#: Program with which to view scrollback in a new window. The
#: scrollback buffer is passed as STDIN to this program. If you change
#: it, make sure the program you use can handle ANSI escape sequences
#: for colors and text formatting. INPUT_LINE_NUMBER in the command
#: line above will be replaced by an integer representing which line
#: should be at the top of the screen.

wheel_scroll_multiplier 5.0

#: Modify the amount scrolled by the mouse wheel or touchpad. Use
#: negative numbers to change scroll direction.

#: }}}

#: Mouse {{{

url_color #0087BD
url_style curly

#: The color and style for highlighting URLs on mouse-over. url_style
#: can be one of: none, single, double, curly

open_url_modifiers kitty_mod

#: The modifier keys to press when clicking with the mouse on URLs to
#: open the URL

open_url_with firefox-developer-edition

#: The program with which to open URLs that are clicked on. The
#: special value default means to use the operating system's default
#: URL handler.

copy_on_select yes

#: Copy to clipboard on select. With this enabled, simply selecting
#: text with the mouse will cause the text to be copied to clipboard.
#: Useful on platforms such as macOS/Wayland that do not have the
#: concept of primary selections. Note that this is a security risk,
#: as all programs, including websites open in your browser can read
#: the contents of the clipboard.

rectangle_select_modifiers ctrl+alt

#: The modifiers to use rectangular selection (i.e. to select text in
#: a rectangular block with the mouse)

select_by_word_characters :@-./_~?&=%+#

#: Characters considered part of a word when double clicking. In
#: addition to these characters any character that is marked as an
#: alpha-numeric character in the unicode database will be matched.

click_interval 0.5

#: The interval between successive clicks to detect double/triple
#: clicks (in seconds)

mouse_hide_wait 3.0

#: Hide mouse cursor after the specified number of seconds of the
#: mouse not being used. Set to zero to disable mouse cursor hiding.

#: }}}

#: Performance tuning {{{

repaint_delay 10

#: Delay (in milliseconds) between screen updates. Decreasing it,
#: increases frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage.
#: The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for
#: most uses. Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS you have to either
#: set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high refresh
#: rate.

input_delay 3

#: Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in
#: the terminal is processed. Note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.

sync_to_monitor yes

#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing)
#: when scrolling. However, it limits the rendering speed to the
#: refresh rate of your monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high
#: keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency. If
#: so, set this to no.

#: }}}

#: Terminal bell {{{

enable_audio_bell no

#: Enable/disable the audio bell. Useful in environments that require
#: silence.

visual_bell_duration 0.0

#: Visual bell duration. Flash the screen when a bell occurs for the
#: specified number of seconds. Set to zero to disable.

window_alert_on_bell yes

#: Request window attention on bell. Makes the dock icon bounce on
#: macOS or the taskbar flash on linux.

#: }}}

#: Window layout {{{

window_margin_width 0.0

#: The window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border)

single_window_margin_width -1000.0

#: The window margin (in pts) to use when only a single window is
#: visible. Negative values will cause the value of
#: window_margin_width to be used instead.

window_padding_width 0.0

inactive_text_alpha 0.60

#: Fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number
#: between zero and one, with zero being fully faded).

#: }}}

#: Color scheme {{{

foreground #e5c7a9
background #292520

#: The foreground and background colors

background_opacity         0.9
dynamic_background_opacity no

#: The opacity of the background. A number between 0 and 1, where 1 is
#: opaque and 0 is fully transparent.  This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the default background color's
#: opacity. This is so that things like the status bar in vim,
#: powerline prompts, etc. still look good.  But it means that if you
#: use a color theme with a background color in your editor, it will
#: not be rendered as transparent.  Instead you should change the
#: default background color in your kitty config and not use a
#: background color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape
#: codes to set the terminals default colors in a shell script to
#: launch your editor.  Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a
#: (possibly significant) performance hit.  If you want to dynamically
#: change transparency of windows set dynamic_background_opacity to
#: yes (this is off by default as it has a performance cost)

dim_opacity 0.75

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

selection_foreground #e6d0ba
selection_background #171a1e

#: The foreground and background for text selected with the mouse

#: The 16 terminal colors. There are 8 basic colors, each color has a
#: dull and bright version. You can also set the remaining colors from
#: the 256 color table as color16 to color255.

color0 #171a1e
color8 #797268

#: black

color1 #c65f4b
color9 #ef8373

#: red

color2  #a1c96c
color10 #b3df60

#: green

color3  #efbc55
color11 #e5db82

color6  #70a16b
color14 #a8eca2

#: cyan

color7  #e6d0ba
color15 #f8f8f1

#: white

#: }}}

#: Advanced {{{

close_on_child_death no

#: Close the window when the child process (shell) exits. If no (the
#: default), the terminal will remain open when the child exits as
#: long as there are still processes outputting to the terminal (for
#: example disowned or backgrounded processes). If yes, the window
#: will close as soon as the child process exits. Note that setting it
#: to yes means that any background processes still using the terminal
#: can fail silently because their stdout/stderr/stdin no longer work.

clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary

#: Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
#: clipboard. You can control exactly which actions are allowed. The
#: set of possible actions is: write-clipboard read-clipboard write-
#: primary read-primary The default is to allow writing to the
#: clipboard and primary selection. Note that enabling the read
#: functionality is a security risk as it means that any program, even
#: one running on a remote server via SSH can read your clipboard.

term xterm-kitty

#: The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on Stack Overflow
#: to change it.

#: }}}

#: Keyboard shortcuts {{{

#: For a list of key names, see: GLFW keys
#: <http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__keys.html>. The name to use
#: is the part after the GLFW_KEY_ prefix. For a list of modifier
#: names, see: GLFW mods
#: <http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__mods.html>

#: On Linux you can also use XKB key names to bind keys that are not
#: supported by GLFW. See XKB keys
#: <https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/blob/master/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-
#: keysyms.h> for a list of key names. The name to use is the part
#: after the XKB_KEY_ prefix. Note that you should only use an XKB key
#: name for keys that are not present in the list of GLFW keys.

#: You can use the special action no_op to unmap a keyboard shortcut
#: that is assigned in the default configuration.

#: You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single
#: shortcut, using the syntax below::

#:     map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...

#: For example::

#:     map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout

#: this will create a new window and switch to the next available
#: layout

#: You can use multi-key shortcuts using the syntax shown below::

#:     map key1>key2>key3 action

#: For example::

#:     map ctrl+f>2 set_font_size 20

kitty_mod ctrl+shift

#: The value of kitty_mod is used as the modifier for all default
#: shortcuts, you can change it in your kitty.conf to change the
#: modifiers for all the default shortcuts.

clear_all_shortcuts yes

#: You can have kitty remove all shortcut definition seen up to this
#: point. Useful, for instance, to remove the default shortcuts.

#: Clipboard {{{

map kitty_mod+c  copy_to_clipboard
map kitty_mod+v  paste_from_clipboard
map kitty_mod+s  paste_from_selection
map shift+insert paste_from_selection
map kitty_mod+o  pass_selection_to_program

#: You can also pass the contents of the current selection to any
#: program using pass_selection_to_program. By default, the system's
#: open program is used, but you can specify your own, for example::

#:     map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program firefox

#: You can pass the current selection to a terminal program running in
#: a new kitty window, by using the @selection placeholder::

#:     map kitty_mod+y new_window less @selection

#: }}}

#: Font sizes {{{

#: You can change the font size for all top-level kitty windows at a
#: time or only the current one.

map kitty_mod+equal     change_font_size current +2.0
map ctrl+minus     change_font_size current -2.0
map ctrl+equal change_font_size current 0

#: To setup shortcuts for specific font sizes::

#:     map kitty_mod+f6 change_font_size all 10.0

#: To setup shortcuts to change only the current window's font size::

#:     map kitty_mod+f6 change_font_size current 10.0
#: }}}

#: Miscellaneous {{{

# map kitty_mod+a>m set_background_opacity +0.1
# map kitty_mod+a>l set_background_opacity -0.1
# map kitty_mod+a>1 set_background_opacity 1
# map kitty_mod+a>d set_background_opacity default
